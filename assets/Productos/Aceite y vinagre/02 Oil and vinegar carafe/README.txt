2. HOW TO USE

We do our best to make all products simple to use. The name of any file contains the volume number, the product number and some description. For example mpm_vol.05_p01_vray.MAX means the product number 1 from volume 5 prepared for use in *.max scenes with vray rendering system. Some models are provided with different materials variations. All available variations are showed in jpg-previews, in the pdf-catalogue of the volume or at the website www.modelplusmodel.com. To get a model with another material do the following: select the model, choose the material you want from the material library or *.mat file and assign it. Note that materials are available only for 3ds Max scenes with scanline or v-ray rendering system. V-ray materials are available in gamma 1.0 and 2.2.
